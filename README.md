# **Building Recommender System: Movies**

---

# **Overview**  
A **content-based movie recommendation system** designed to suggest movies based on features like **genre**, **story**, and **lead studio**. It leverages **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** and **Cosine Similarity** to evaluate and recommend movies with similar characteristics.

# **Features**  
- **Content-based Recommendations**: Suggest movies by analyzing textual data such as **genre**, **story**, and **lead studio**.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing/null values, normalization of numerical features, and duplicate removal.  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts textual data into numerical representations.  
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between movies based on their feature vectors.
